    b. Code is properly indented and formatted.

2. Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
    a. Redundant code is removed.
    b. Copied and pasted code is refactored into reusable functions or classes.

3. Code is modular:
    a. Code is broken into smaller, reusable pieces like modules and functions.
        i. Modules have single responsibilities and are independent.

4. Code is efficient:
    a. The cost of operations is understood.
        b. Unnecessary calculations are avoided.
    c. The correct data structures and algorithms are used.
    d. Optimization is not performed until a proven bottleneck exists.

5. Code is robust and handles errors gracefully:
    a. Inputs are validated.
    b. Exceptions are handled properly.
    c. Meaningful error messages are provided.

6. Code is testable:
    a. Code is designed for easy testing.
        i. Functions and classes have clear inputs and outputs.
        ii. There are no hidden dependencies.
        iii. Each piece of code does one thing well.

7. Code follows a coding standard:
    a. For PHP, follow PSR-2

8. Code is well-documented:
    a. Comments explain why something is done in an easy-to-understand way. 
    b. PHPDoc blocks are used for classes, methods, and variables when needed.
